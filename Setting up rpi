1 way
without monitor,
1)go to root folder of rpi called 'boot'
2)Create file "wpa_supplicant.conf"
  Note: The extension of the file should be .conf itself, not txt or anything else.
  Enter the following code
  
%%
country=IN                    % replace with your country code
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
network={
    ssid="WIFI_NETWORK_NAME"  % Enter your wifi name
    psk="WIFI_PASSWORD"       % Enter your wifi password
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
%%

3)Create another file in the root folder(boot) called "ssh"(no extensions)
4) Now remove the sd card
